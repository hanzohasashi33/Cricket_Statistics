#CRICKET STATISTICS(VCH).

PROJECT DESCRIPTION :
Our project is to create a user interactive program which allows users to modify stastical data on bowlers and batsmen with the help of file handling.
Our project contains two database files , one for bowler and one for batsmen.
Our project contains only the ODI statistics of all the players.



Our projects contains the following four modules :
1.DISPLAY RECORDS : 
    This module displays the database on the terminal according to user specifications.
    For example,If the user wants to see the statistics of all the batsmen/bowler of a given country he can do so by using this module.
    There are all types of display options in this module so as to give the user more flexibility


2.ADD RECORDS :
    With this module the user can add new records to the existing database with the help of a user interactive prompt.


3.DELETE RECORDS :
    With the help of this module the user can delete the statistical record of a batsmen/bowler from the database.
    The user will have to provide the name of the batsmen/bowler to be deleted and the program deletes the corresponding record.

4.EDIT RECORDS :
    With this module the user can edit the statistical data of an already existing batsmen/bowler.
    The user can change any part of the database item he wants to.
    This is particularly helpful if the user has accidently entered wrong or misleading data and wants to change them.
